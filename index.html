                    <p><strong>Translated Lorem Ipsum:</strong> But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea
                        of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the
                        system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
                        of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is
                        pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
                        consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or
                        desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
                        occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
                        which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from
                        it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no
                        annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</p>
